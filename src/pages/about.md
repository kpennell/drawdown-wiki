title: About Drawdown Wiki
---
Project Drawdown is an amazing project that quantifies and prioritizes different solutions for reducing and eventually removing CO2 from the atmosphere. PD started as a book and website and later on, a Facebook discussion group was formed. This Facebook group is full of hundreds of people who are passionate about solving climate change. Many of us (in the group) are frustrated with Project Drawdown's slow work and lack of outreach, especially as we read of accelerating climate change. We'd like to find a way to build upon and contribute to the PD framework.

This "Drawdown Wiki" is an early first draft on what a community driven Drawdown site could look like.

This site was made by Kyle Pennell and the code for it lives here: https://github.com/kpennell/drawdown-wiki
